METHODS

The sample we analyzed derived from a longitudinal study of 344 youth between the ages of 3 and 18 whose early caregiving experiences involved institutional care (i.e., adoption or foster care, N = 115) or whose biological families raised them (N = 229). The sample retained for this study included the first (N = 117) or second (N = 39) waves of the above, whichever was the first for each particpant. All participants recruited at the third wave were excluded because a different MRI machine was used.

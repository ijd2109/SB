  abstract = {The importance of early experiences for mental health across the lifespan is well recognized. In particular, there is a strong association between adverse caregiving experiences and mental illness. However, relative to studies assessing outcomes in adults, there are far fewer studies assessing the earlier emerging manifestations of caregiving adversity during development. This lack of developmental research limits an understanding of the mechanisms that link adversity with mental illness. Adoption of a developmental approach to research in this field will yield greater insights into the factors that tie adversity to poor emotion function across a lifespan. In this review, we focus on recent findings that have used a developmental approach in the examination of mental health and early adversity. These studies are notable in that, across numerous species, they converge on the idea that early adversity leads to accelerated maturation of emotion circuits in the brain and in the behaviors supported by these regions. We propose that these ‘stress acceleration’ effects are evidence of early system adaptation.},

  abstract = {Objective
Pediatricians report many barriers to caring for children with mental health (MH) problems. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has focused attention on MH problems but the impact on perceived barriers is unknown. We examined whether perceived barriers and their correlates changed from 2004 to 2013.

Methods
In 2004, 832/1600 (52\%) and in 2013, 594/1617 (36.7\%) of randomly selected AAP members surveyed responded to Periodic Surveys, answering questions about socio-demographics, practice characteristics, and 7 barriers to identifying, treating/managing and referring child/adolescent MH problems. To reduce non-response bias, weighted descriptive and logistic regression analyses were conducted.

Results
Lack of training in treatment of child MH problems (\textasciitilde{}65\%) and lack of confidence treating children with counseling (\textasciitilde{}60\%) did not differ across surveys. Five barriers (lack of training in identifying MH problems, lack of confidence diagnosing, lack of confidence treating with medications, inadequate reimbursement and lack of time) were less frequently endorsed in 2013 (all p{$<$}.01), although lack of time was still endorsed by 70\% in 2013. In 2004, 34\% of pediatricians endorsed 6 or 7 barriers compared to 26\% in 2013 (p{$<$}.005). Practicing general pediatrics exclusively was associated with endorsing 6 or 7 barriers in both years (p {$<$}.001).

Conclusion
Although fewer barriers were endorsed in 2013, most pediatricians believe that they have inadequate training in treating child MH problems, a lack of confidence to counsel children, and limited time for these problems. These findings suggest significant barriers still exist, highlighting the need for improved developmental and behavioral pediatrics training.

What’s New
This study compares reported barriers from the 2004 and 2013 Periodic Surveys. Although pediatricians report fewer barriers in 2013, 66\% continue to report lack of training in counseling or medication of children with MH problems, suggesting deficits in developmental and behavioral pediatrics training.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many children who have a mental health disorder do not receive mental health services and are seen only in primary care settings. Perceptions of pediatricians and mental health specialists regarding the role that pediatricians should have in diagnosing and managing children's mental health problems have not been studied.
OBJECTIVE: To examine whether primary care pediatricians (PCPs) and child and adolescent psychiatrists (CAPs) agree about: (1) the pediatrician's role in identification, referral, and treatment of childhood mental health (MH) disorders; and (2) barriers to the identification, referral, and treatment of childhood MH disorders.
METHODS: Surveys were mailed in 2005 to 338 PCPs and 75 CAPs in 7 counties surrounding Cleveland, Ohio. Each group was asked whether they agreed that PCPs should be responsible for identifying, treating, or referring 7 prevalent childhood MH problems. Barriers that PCPs face in identification, referral, and treatment of MH problems were also assessed. Analyses were weighted for nonresponse; group differences were assessed via Rao-Scott chi test and weighted regression analyses.
RESULTS: Approximately half of PCPs and CAPs returned the survey. With the exception of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the majority of PCPs and CAPs agreed that pediatricians should be responsible for identifying and referring, but not treating child MH conditions. For ADHD, PCPs were more likely than CAPs to agree that pediatricians should identify and treat affected children. PCPs were more likely than CAPs to agree that pediatricians should be responsible for identifying child/adolescent depression and anxiety disorders; the majority of both groups agree that PCPs should be responsible for referring, but not treating these conditions. Both groups agree that lack of MH services is a barrier to identification, treatment, and referral of child MH problems for PCPs. CAPs were more likely to agree that pediatrician's lack of training in identifying child mental health problems was a barrier, whereas PCPs were more likely to endorse lack of confidence in their ability to treat child MH problems with counseling, long waiting periods to see MH providers, family failure to follow through on referrals, and billing/reimbursement issues as barriers.
CONCLUSIONS: Most PCPs and CAPs believe it is pediatricians' responsibility to identify and refer, but not treat, the majority of children's mental health problems. Both groups agree that mental health services are not readily available. Future efforts are needed to support PCPs and CAPs in their combined effort to address the mental health needs of children.},

  abstract = {Objective. The prevalence of psychiatric disorder in children and adolescents with functional recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) is unknown. Our aim was to determine whether RAP is associated with psychiatric symptoms and disorders, anxious temperament, and functional impairment in pediatric primary care.
Methods. Children and adolescents who were 8 to 15 years of age, inclusive, and presented with RAP (N = 42) or for routine care in the absence of recurrent pain (N = 38) were identified by a screening procedure in pediatric primary care office waiting rooms and recruited to participate in a case-control study. Outcome measures were psychiatric diagnoses generated by standardized psychiatric interview administered blind to subject status and self, parent, and clinician ratings of child psychiatric symptoms, temperamental traits, and functional status.
Results. RAP patients were significantly more likely to receive a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder, with a categorical anxiety disorder in 33 (79\%) and a depressive disorder in 18 patients (43\%), and higher levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms, temperamental harm avoidance, and functional impairment than control subjects. Anxiety disorders (mean age of onset: 6.25 [standard deviation: 2.17] years) were significantly more likely to precede RAP (mean age of onset: 9.17 [standard deviation: 2.75] years) in patients with associated anxiety.
Conclusions. Youths who present with RAP in primary care deserve careful assessment for anxiety and depressive disorders. Future studies should examine treatments that are proved to be efficacious for pediatric anxiety and/or depressive disorders as potential interventions for RAP. Longitudinal, family, and psychobiological studies are needed to illuminate the nature of observed associations among RAP, anxiety, and depression.},

  abstract = {Objective
Mental health policy for youth has been constrained by a paucity of nationally representative data concerning patterns and correlates of mental health service utilization in this segment of the population. The objectives of this investigation were to examine the rates and sociodemographic correlates of lifetime mental health service use by severity, type, and number of DSM-IV disorders in the National Comorbidity Survey–Adolescent Supplement.
Method
Face-to-face survey of mental disorders from 2002 to 2004 using a modified version of the fully structured World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview in a nationally representative sample of 6,483 adolescents 13 to 18 years old for whom information on service use was available from an adolescent and a parent report. Total and sector-specific mental health service use was also assessed.
Results
Approximately one third of adolescents with mental disorders received services for their illness (36.2\%). Although disorder severity was significantly associated with an increased likelihood of receiving treatment, half of adolescents with severely impairing mental disorders had never received mental health treatment for their symptoms. Service rates were highest in those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (59.8\%) and behavior disorders (45.4\%), but fewer than one in five affected adolescents received services for anxiety, eating, or substance use disorders. Comorbidity and severe impairment were strongly associated with service utilization, particularly in youth with behavior disorders. Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black adolescents were less likely than their White counterparts to receive services for mood and anxiety disorders, even when such disorders were associated with severe impairment.
Conclusions
Despite advances in public awareness of mental disorders in youth, a substantial proportion of young people with severe mental disorders have never received specialty mental health care. Marked racial disparities in lifetime rates of mental health treatment highlight the urgent need to identify and combat barriers to the recognition and treatment of these conditions.},

  abstract = {Background Mental health problems are common and typically have an early onset. Effective treatments for mental health problems in childhood and adolescence are available, yet only a minority of children who are affected access them. This is of serious concern, considering the far-reaching and long-term negative consequences of such problems. Primary care is usually the first port of call for concerned parents so it is important to understand how primary care practitioners manage child and adolescent mental health problems and the barriers they face.
Aim To ascertain primary care practitioners’ perceptions of the barriers that prevent effective management of child and adolescent mental health problems.
Design and setting A systematic review of qualitative and quantitative literature in a primary care setting.
Method A database search of peer-reviewed articles using PsycINFO, MEDLINE®, Embase, and Web of Science, from inception (earliest 1806) until October 2014, was conducted. Additional studies were identified through hand searches and forward-citation searches. Studies needed to have at least one search term in four categories: primary care, childhood/adolescence, mental health, and barriers.
Results A total of 4151 articles were identified, of which 43 were included (30 quantitative studies and 13 qualitative studies). The majority of the barriers related to identification, management, and/or referral. Considerable barriers included a lack of providers and resources, extensive waiting lists, and financial restrictions.
Conclusion The identification of a broad range of significant barriers highlights the need to strengthen the ability to deal with these common difficulties in primary care. There is a particular need for tools and training to aid accurate identification and management, and for more efficient access to specialist services.},

These disorders can result in significant academic, social, and familial impairment. Early identification in pediatric primary care and effective management may help improve outcomes.
        Recent findings~Self-report measures of pediatric anxiety can supplement the clinical interview and assist in screening children and adolescents for separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and social phobia. Substantial evidence supports the use of cognitive behavioral therapy and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the treatment of pediatric anxiety disorders. Although treatment with serotonin reuptake inhibitors may lead to a small increase in the risk for suicidal ideation in children and adolescents, the risk benefit ratio for serotonin reuptake inhibitor use in pediatric anxiety disorders is favorable with appropriate monitoring.
        Summary~Although evidence-support treatments have emerged for pediatric anxiety disorders, their effectiveness in pediatric primary care has not been evaluated. Future research should assess the delivery of manual-based cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders by mental health professionals integrated into the primary care settings, the effectiveness of serotonin reuptake inhibitor prescription by pediatric primary care clinicians, and the use of collaborative models for providing anxiety treatments for children and adolescents in primary care settings.},

  abstract = {This study examined the incidence and correlates of functional gastrointestinal symptoms in children with anxiety disorders. Participants were 6–13 year old children diagnosed with one or more anxiety disorders (n = 54) and non-clinical control children (n = 51). Telephone diagnostic interviews were performed with parents to determine the presence and absence of anxiety disorders in children. Parents completed a questionnaire that elicited information about their child’s gastrointestinal symptoms associated with functional gastrointestinal disorders in children, as specified by the paediatric Rome criteria (Caplan et al., Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology \& Nutrition, 41, 296–304, 2005a). Parents and children also completed a symptom severity measure of anxiety. As expected, children with anxiety disorders were significantly more likely to have symptoms of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID), compared to children without anxiety disorders. That is, 40.7 \% of anxious children had symptoms of a FGID compared to 5.9 \% of non-anxious control children. Children with anxiety disorders were significantly more likely to have symptoms of functional constipation, and showed a trend for a higher incidence of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms compared to non-anxious control children. Furthermore, higher anxiety symptom severity was characteristic of anxious children with symptoms of FGID, compared to anxious children without FGID symptoms and non-anxious control children. Also, children with anxiety disorders, regardless of FGID symptoms, were more likely to have a biological family member, particularly a parent or grandparent, with a gastrointestinal problem, compared to non-anxious control children. The high incidence of FGID symptoms in children with anxiety disorders warrants further research on whether gastrointestinal symptoms reduce following psychological treatments for childhood anxiety disorders, such as cognitive behavioural therapy.},

  abstract = {A deeper understanding of the gut–brain axis is of significance in pediatrics, given the influential role of early childhood experiences and exposures in shaping the microbiome, and health, across the life course. This systematic review synthesized evidence on the connection between the gut microbiome and mental health in children with physical illness. Six electronic databases were systematically searched and data extracted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Of 1,476 identified articles, 11 articles reporting on nine unique studies (all randomized controlled trials) were included. Most studies examined the gut microbiome in infants with colic, while the remaining studies investigated outcomes in children aged 1 day to 18 years at risk for atopic dermatitis or irritable bowel syndrome. Baseline and postintervention gut microbiome differences varied across studies. Findings on psychological functioning also varied, with only half of the captured studies showing a positive effect of intervention on psychological well-being. Only two studies analyzed the association between the gut microbiome and psychological outcomes, each with a different pattern of results. As the field moves forward, it will be critical to gain a better understanding of the microbiome characteristics that influence mental health outcomes in pediatric populations.},

  abstract = {Background: In clinical studies there is a strong relationship between gastrointestinal symptoms, anxiety and depression. The results may be biased, however, since anxiety and depression will influence the decision to consult a doctor. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between these symptoms in the population. Methods: In the Health Study of Nord-Trøndelag County of Norway (HUNT) a questionnaire concerning physical and mental health, demographic and life-style factors was sent to all inhabitants aged 20 years and above (a total of 94,197 persons). Valid questionnaires were returned by 62,651 persons (66.5\%). Presence of nausea, heartburn, diarrhoea and constipation during the last year was self-reported. Anxiety disorders and depression were based on self-ratings of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results: 48\% of the population reported one or more of the four gastrointestinal symptoms. Based on the HADS ratings, 15.3\% of the population had an anxiety disorder and 10.4\% a depression. Anxiety disorder was most strongly associated with nausea (OR 3.42). Anxiety was also associated with heartburn, diarrhoea and constipation, but weaker than with nausea. Depression was less strongly associated with the four gastrointestinal symptoms. Demographic factors, life-style factors and extra-gastrointestinal complaints could not explain the effect of anxiety disorders and depression on these gastrointestinal symptoms. Conclusions: In this population study there was a strong relationship between gastrointestinal symptoms, anxiety disorders and depression. These findings suggest that mental disorders in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms are not merely a consequence of selection bias in patient materials but connected to the symptoms themselves.},

As a result, ambitions to achieve clinically useful tools to assist in the diagnosis and management of mental health and learning disorders are gaining momentum. To this end, it is critical to accrue large-scale multimodal datasets that capture a broad range of commonly encountered clinical psychopathology. The Child Mind Institute has launched the Healthy Brain Network (HBN), an ongoing initiative focused on creating and sharing a biobank of data from 10,000 New York area participants (ages 5–21). The HBN Biobank houses data about psychiatric, behavioral, cognitive, and lifestyle phenotypes, as well as multimodal brain imaging (resting and naturalistic viewing fMRI, diffusion MRI, morphometric MRI), electroencephalography, eye-tracking, voice and video recordings, genetics and actigraphy. Here, we present the rationale, design and implementation of HBN protocols. We describe the first data release (n=664) and the potential of the biobank to advance related areas (e.g., biophysical modeling, voice analysis).},

A subject-centric internal organization allows researchers to capture and subsequently extract all information, longitudinal or cross-sectional, from any subset of the study cohort. Extensive error-checking and quality control procedures, security, data management, data querying, and administrative functions provide LORIS with a triple capability (1) continuous project coordination and monitoring of data acquisition (2) data storage/cleaning/querying, (3) interface with arbitrary external data processing “pipelines.” LORIS is a complete solution that has been thoroughly tested through a full 10 year life cycle of a multi-center longitudinal project1 and is now supporting numerous international neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration research projects.},

  abstract = {Gastrointestinal and mental disorders are highly comorbid, and animal models have shown that both can be caused by early adversity (e.g., parental deprivation). Interactions between the brain and bacteria that live within the gastrointestinal system (the microbiome) underlie adversity-gastrointestinal-anxiety interactions, but these links have not been investigated during human development. In this study, we utilized data from a population of 344 youth (3-18 years old) who were raised with their biological parents or were exposed to early adverse caregiving experiences (i.e., institutional or foster care followed by international adoption) to explore adversity-gastrointestinal-anxiety associations. In Study 1, we demonstrated that previous adverse care experiences were associated with increased incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms in youth. Gastrointestinal symptoms were also associated with concurrent and future anxiety (measured across 5 years), and those gastrointestinal symptoms mediated the adversity-anxiety association at Time 1. In a subsample of children who provided both stool samples and functional magnetic resonance imaging of the brain (Study 2, which was a "proof-of-principle"), adversity was associated with changes in diversity (both alpha and beta) of microbial communities, and bacteria levels (adversity-associated and adversity-independent) were correlated with prefrontal cortex activation to emotional faces. Implications of these data for supporting youth mental health are discussed.},

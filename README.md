# SB
SB data analysis scripts and output.

TO-DO now: 
- decide one outcome for all different models.
- random forest with structural PCs
- cross validation on hold-out set
- potential (very last thing): predict PACCT outcomes using behaviral measures, and compare to the validation of the models built with SB.
- discuss with mvt and pab potentially redundat structural variables
-To try later: clustering the 69 regions first into features, and then using those to predit CBCL and group classification.
- ROC curve (pROC package)
- compare the
- create a confint for rsq from each model.
Notes about the data files:
* Data used in PCA and random forest are the wave 1 data, unless a participant had no wave 1 data, but wave 3 was always omitted, and the youngest age collected was utilized if possible.

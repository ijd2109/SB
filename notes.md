**Notes**
SB282, SB058, SB102, and SB163 have all three waves of FC data, but only volumetric MRI at waves 2 and 3. 
    - As of 3/7/2020, structural data from wave two has been merged in
    - As of 3/7/2020, the FC data frame still contains wave one time series
    - The wave1Labels.rds has an updated "wave_to_pull" and "uniq_key" to reflect wave 2 is to be used
For SB028, SB155, SB201, and SB202 no structural data exists.
For ** SB258**, functional data exists at wave 1, but structural only at wave 2. Each is used except in join analyses.
